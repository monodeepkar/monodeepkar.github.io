I am currently a  research scientist in the Circuits Research Labs, [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html). I received my B.Tech and M.tech in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2012 and my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA where I worked with Dr. [Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/). 

My current research focuses on hardware acceleration of computer vision/robotics algorithms, hardware security and power management.
